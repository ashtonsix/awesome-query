Awesome Conferences
===================

A list of awesome conferences. Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists thing.

This was seeded initially from [@brittanystoroz's Twitter list](https://twitter.com/brittanystoroz/confs-and-meetups/). The `O-Reilly` folder is the dedicated front end where you can filter through all of the conferences listed by @joshsimmons on his [excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ttYpVdCRb8G3ulesFrg6OvpJGKEXk6kmmtGWsyqWFw4/edit#gid=0). Initial work on this list was done by [@Stephn-R](https://github.com/Stephn-R).

###What makes a conference awesome?

 * A [code of conduct](http://incisive.nu/2014/codes-of-conduct/) that is [explicitly mentioned and upheld](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/a-code-of-conduct-is-not-enough). For more on this, see [this](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/making-tech-spaces-safe-for-diverse-faces)
 * A great line up of talks
 * A recurring schedule
 * Diversity; both in the talks and in the community who attend.
 * Grants for students and minorities.
 * [Accessibility](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/unlocking-the-invisible-elevator-accessibility-at-tech-conferences) for disabled persons: wheelchair access, [interpreters](http://www.linguabee.com/) or captioning, etc.
 * Alcohol-free drink options
 * Quiet rooms and safe space

_Many of the links above are to Model View Culture's issue on events. I have linked them because, by and large, they are well written and exhaustive on the subject. I highly suggest reading [Model View Culture](http://modelviewculture.com/), if you haven't heard of it yet. Other articles and links are very, very welcome._
